            <p>Inflation is 
                <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp" target="_blank">defined</a> 
                as a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money. Inflation is measured by the consumer price index (CPI), which is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. Inflation is a persistent increase in the general level of prices for goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money â€“ a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy.
